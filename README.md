# Bandcamp Crawler

At the moment, this crawls bandcamp albums and scrapes data on the album. The script stores a link to the album and info on the author, price, and stuff like that. It also stores links to recommended albums. Can make a big graph of stuff. 

Can also be used to download individual songs and albums pretty easily, but that seems a little sketchy... :/
